# Concurrency Project

A concurrency based game environment

This project's aim is to develop a gaming environment with the following:

1. error reporting
2. nice GUI
3. Multiple games to be played simultaneously
4. Error reporting
5. Chat room
6. Must have concurrency and sharing



Early Deliverables

Proof of concept program: A prototype implementation of a board game (e.g., chess).
Proof of concept program: A prototype program that exhibits the behaviour of concurrent execution.
Report: A survey report on game environments.
Report: A description of the prototype implementations.

Final Deliverables

The system must be implemented according to modern software engineering principles.
The environment should contain a working system, with functionalities such as error reporting.
A graphical interface should be implemented.
The environment should allow the users to play multiple games at the same time.
The report should provide an overview of game-playing environments.
The report should describe the environment including its functionalities and design.
The report should describe the implementation issues (such as the choice of data structures, numerical methods etc) necessary to apply the theory.
The report should describe the testing procedures of the environment.
The report should describe the software engineering process involved in the design and implementation.
